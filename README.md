# timer_app

1. When opened it should display a blank screen with a "start" button

2. When the button is clicked, the elapsed time should appear on the screen, as well as a "stop" button.

3. When the "stop button is clicked" the timer should freeze at the current moment, and two buttons should display: "resume" and "reset".

4. If "resume" is clicked, the timer should continue counting from the moment it was paused. If "reset" is clicked, the screen should only display a "start" button once again.
